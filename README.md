Data, analysis, and report for a laboratory exercise exploring the oscillatory kinetics of the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction through analysis of spectral data over time for the seemingly homogeneous three-dimensional process and of wave propagation in the inhomogeneous two-dimensional case following the procedure by Gasyna and Scherer.

Observations are in the data directory. The scripts used to analyse the data with MATLAB are in the scripts directory, and the plots output are in the plots directory. A report submitted for evaluation is in the report directory.
